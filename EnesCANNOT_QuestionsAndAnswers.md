## 1) What is Git?

Git is the most widely used version control system in the world. It is a free and open-source distributed version control system that records changes made to code over time in a special database called a repository. Git allows users to track project history, see who made changes and when, and revert the project to an earlier state if necessary. It is popular due to its speed, scalability, and efficient handling of branching and merging operations. Git enables developers to collaborate on projects, with each team member having a copy of the project with its history on their machine, allowing for local saving of project snapshots and synchronization with others even if the central server is offline.

## 2) What is the difference between "git pull" and "git fetch" commands?

`git fetch` downloads new data from a remote repository without integrating it into your working files, allowing you to review the changes before integrating them into your local repository.

`git pull`, on the other hand, downloads new data and directly integrates it into your current working copy files, which can be faster but also introduces changes and conflicts into your local repository.

`git fetch` is safer as it only downloads new data, while `git pull` integrates it into your current working copy files, which can cause conflicts and changes that require manual resolution.

## 3) If our teammate says "I sent my codes, continue with my development" and we cannot get the codes she/he sent to our local location with "git pull", what could be a mistake?

If your teammate says that she/he has sent her/his codes, but you are unable to get those codes locally with git pull, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some common mistakes to check:

- **Repository not pushed to remote:** 
Ensure that your teammate has pushed her changes to the remote repository. If not, you will not be able to get those changes with git pull.

- **Incorrect branch name:** 
Check that you are using the correct branch name for your teammate's code. You can use git branch -a to see a list of all available branches.

- **Permissions issue:** 
Check if there are any permission issues with the remote repository. If you don't have the necessary permissions to pull changes, you will not be able to get the latest changes.

By checking for these common mistakes, you can identify and resolve any issues with getting your teammate's latest changes with git pull.

## 4) What does "origin" in the "git fetch origin" command correspond to?

In the command "git fetch origin", "origin" represents the default name assigned to the remote repository from which you want to fetch changes. It is typically the alias given to the original repository URL when you clone a Git repository. This allows you to refer to the remote repository using a short and memorable name.
